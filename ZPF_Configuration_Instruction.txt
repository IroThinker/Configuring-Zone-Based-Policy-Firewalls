 Background
The most basic form of a Cisco IOS firewall uses access control lists (ACLs) to filter IP traffic and monitor established traffic patterns. A traditional Cisco IOS firewall is an ACL-based firewall.
The newer Cisco IOS Firewall implementation uses a zone-based approach that operates as a function of interfaces instead of access control lists. A Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF) allows different inspection policies to be applied to multiple host groups connected to the same router interface. It can be configured for extremely advanced, protocol specific, granular control. It prohibits traffic via a default deny-all policy between different firewall zones. ZPF is suited for multiple interfaces that have similar or varying security requirements. 
In this workshop, you build a multi-router network, configure the routers and PC hosts, and configure a Zone-Based Policy Firewall using the Cisco IOS command line interface (CLI).
Note: Make sure that the routers and switches have been erased and have no startup configurations.

Basic Router Configuration
In Part 1, you set up the network topology and configure basic settings, such as the interface IP addresses, static routing, device access, and passwords.
Note: All tasks should be performed on routers R1, R2, and R3. The procedures are shown for only one of the routers.
Step 1: Cable the network as shown in the topology.
Attach the devices as shown in the topology diagram, and cable as necessary.
Step 2: Enable the Security License
a. Configure host names as shown in the topology.
b. First check if the Securityk9 license is activated
R1#show license
c. If not activated enter the following command 
R1(config)#license boot module c1900 technology-package securityk9
d. Answer yes to accept the terms
e. Save the configuration and reload your router by using the following commands
R1#write
R1#reload
f. Check if the Securityk9 license is activated now activated
R1#show license


Step 3: Configure basic settings for each router.
a.	Configure the interface IP addresses as shown in the IP addressing table.
c.	Configure a clock rate for the serial router interfaces with a DCE serial cable attached.
R2(config)# interface S0/0/0
R2(config-if)# clock rate 64000
Step 4: Disable DNS lookup.
To prevent the router from attempting to translate incorrectly entered commands, disable DNS lookup.
R2(config)# no ip domain-lookup
Step 5: Configure static routes on R1, R2, and R3.
a. In order to achieve end-to-end IP reachability, proper static routes must be configured on R1, R2 and R3. R1 and R3 are stub routers, and as such, only need a default route pointing to R2. R2, behaving as the ISP, must know how to reach R1’s and R3’s internal networks before end-to-end IP reachability is achieved. Below is the static route configuration for R1, R2 and R3. On R1, use the following command:
R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.2

b. On R2, use the following commands.
R2(config)# ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.1.1
R2(config)# ip route 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.2.2.1
R2(config)# ip route 192.168.33.0 255.255.255.0 10.2.2.1
c. On R3, use the following command.
R3(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.2.2.2
Step 6: Configure PC host IP settings.
Configure a static IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for PC-A, PC-B, and PC-C as shown in the IP addressing table.
Step 7: Verify basic network connectivity.
a. Ping from R1 to R3.
If the pings are not successful, troubleshoot the basic device configurations before continuing.
b. Ping from PC-A on the R1 LAN to PC-C on the R3 LAN.
If the pings are not successful, troubleshoot the basic device configurations before continuing.
Note: If you can ping from PC-A to PC-C, you have demonstrated that the end-to-end IP reachability has been achieved. If you cannot ping but the device interfaces are UP and IP addresses are correct, use the show interface, show ip interface, and show ip route commands to help identify problems.



Step 8: Configure a user account, encrypted passwords and crypto keys for SSH.
Note: Passwords in this task are set to a minimum of 10 characters, but are relatively simple for the benefit of performing the workshop. More complex passwords are recommended in a production network. If you can’t remember how to configure any of the following, refer to workshop 1.
a. Configure a minimum password length using the security passwords command to set a minimum password length of 10 characters.
b. Configure a domain name.
c. Configure crypto keys for SSH
d. Configure an admin01 user account using and a password of cisco12345.
e. Configure line console 0 to use the local user database for logins. For additional security, the exec-timeout command causes the line to log out after 5 minutes of inactivity. The logging synchronous command prevents console messages from interrupting command entry.
Note: To avoid repetitive logins during this workshop, the exec-timeout command can be set to 0 0, which prevents it from expiring; however, this is not considered to be a good security practice.
f. Configure line aux 0 to use the local user database for logins.
g. Configure line vty 0 4 to use the local user database for logins and restrict access to SSH connections only.
h. Configure the enable password with strong encryption.
i. From your router’s PC, open an SSH connection to the other 2 routers using putty.
j. When you are successful, capture the other routers and paste it here:

Part 2: Configuring a Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF)
In Part 2, you configure a zone-based policy firewall (ZPF) on R3 using the command line interface (CLI).
Task 1: Verify Current Router Configurations.
In this task, you will verify end-to-end network connectivity before implementing ZPF.
Step 1: Verify end-to-end network connectivity.
a. Ping from R1 to R3 Using both of R3’s Gigabit Ethernet interface IP addresses.
If the pings are not successful, troubleshoot the basic device configurations before continuing.
b. Ping from PC-A on the R1 LAN to PC-C on the R3 conference room LAN.
If the pings are not successful, troubleshoot the basic device configurations before continuing.
c. Ping from PC-A on the R1 LAN to PC-B on the R3 internal LAN.
If the pings are not successful, troubleshoot the basic device configurations before continuing. 


Step 2: Display the R3 running configurations.
a. Issue the show ip interface brief command on R3 to verify the correct IP addresses were assigned. Use the IP Address Table to verify the addresses.
b. Issue the show ip route command on R3 to verify it has a static default route pointing to R2’s serial 0/0/1 interface.
c. Issue the show run command to review the current basic configuration on R3.
d. Verify the R3 basic configuration as performed in Part 1 of the workshop. Are there any security commands related to access control?

______________________________________________________________________________
Task 2: Create a Zone-Based Policy Firewall
In this task, you will create a zone-based policy firewall on R3, making it act not only as a router but also as a firewall. 
R3 is currently responsible for routing packets for the three networks connected to it. R3’s interface roles are configured as follows:
Serial 0/0/1 is connected to the Internet. Because this is a public network, it is considered an untrusted network and should have the lowest security level.
G0/1 is connected to the internal network. Only authorized users have access to this network. In addition, vital institution resources also reside in this network. The internal network is to be considered a trusted network and should have the highest security level.
G0/0 is connected to a conference room. The conference room is used to host meetings with people who are not part of the organization.
The security policy to be enforced by R3 when it is acting as a firewall dictates that:
* No traffic initiated from the Internet should be allowed into the internal or conference room networks.
* Returning Internet traffic (return packets coming from the Internet into the R3 site, in response to requests originating from any of the R3 networks) should be allowed.
* Computers in the R3 internal network are considered trusted and are allowed to initiate any type traffic (TCP, UDP or ICMP based traffic).
* Computers in the R3 conference room network are considered untrusted and are allowed to initiate only web traffic (HTTP or HTTPS) to the Internet.
* No traffic is allowed between the internal network and the conference room network. There is no guarantee regarding the condition of guest computers in the conference room network. Such machines could be infected with malware and might attempt to send out spam or other malicious traffic.
Step 1: Creating the security zones.
A security zone is a group of interfaces with similar security properties and requirements. For example, if a router has three interfaces connected to internal networks, all three interfaces can be placed under the same zone named “internal”. Because all security properties are configured to the zone instead of to the individual router interfaces, the firewall design is much more scalable.
In this workshop, the R3 site has three interfaces; one connected to an internal trusted network, one connected to the conference room network and another connected to the Internet. Because all three networks have different security requirements and properties, we will create three different security zones.
a. Security zones are created in global configuration mode, and the command allows for zone name definition. In R3, create three zones named INSIDE, CONFROOM and INTERNET:
R3(config)# zone security INSIDE
R3(config)# zone security CONFROOM
R3(config)# zone security INTERNET

Step 2: Creating Security Policies
Before ZPF can decide if some specific traffic should be allowed or denied, it must be told what traffic is to be considered. Cisco IOS uses class-maps to select traffic. Interesting traffic is a common denomination for traffic that has been selected by a class-map.
While class-maps select traffic, it is not their job to decide what happens to the selected traffic; Policy-maps decide the fate of the selected traffic.
ZPF traffic policies are defined as policy-maps and use class-maps to select traffic. In other words, class-maps define what traffic is to be policed while policy-maps define the action to be taken upon the selected traffic.
Policy-maps can drop, pass or inspect traffic. Because we want the firewall to watch traffic moving in the direction of zone-pairs, we will create inspect policy-maps. Inspect policy-maps allow for dynamic handling of the return traffic.
First, you will create class-maps. After the class-maps are created, you will create policy-maps and attach the class-maps to the policy-maps.
a. Create an inspect class-map to match traffic to be allowed from the INSIDE zone to the INTERNET zone. Because we trust the INSIDE zone, we allow all the main protocols.
In the commands below, the first line creates an inspect class-map. The match-any keyword instructs the router that any of the match protocol statements will qualify as a successful match resulting in a policy being applied. The result is a match for TCP or UDP or ICMP packets.
The match commands refer to specific Cisco NBAR supported protocols. For more information on Cisco NBAR visit Cisco Network-Based Application Recognition.
R3(config)# class-map type inspect match-any INSIDE_PROTOCOLS
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol tcp
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol udp
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol icmp

b. Similarly, create a class-map to match the traffic to be allowed from the CONFROOM zone to the INTERNET zone. Because we do not fully trust the CONFROOM zone, we must limit what the server can send out to the Internet:
R3(config)# class-map type inspect match-any CONFROOM_PROTOCOLS 
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol http
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol https
R3(config-cmap)# match protocol dns

c. Now that the class-maps are created, you can create the policy-maps.
In the commands below, the first line creates an inspect policy-map named INSIDE_TO_INTERNET. The second line binds the previously created INSIDE_PROTOCOLS class-map to the policy-map. All packets matched by the INSIDE_PROTOCOLS class-map will be subjected to the action taken by the INSIDE_TO_INTERNET policy-map. Finally, the third line defines the actual action this policy-map will apply to the matched packets. In this case, the matched packets will be inspected.
The next three lines create a similar policy-map named CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET and attach the CONFROOM_PROTOCOLS class-map.
The commands are as follows: 
R3(config)# policy-map type inspect INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
R3(config-pmap)# class type inspect INSIDE_PROTOCOLS
R3(config-pmap-c)# inspect
R3(config)# policy-map type inspect CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET
R3(config-pmap)# class type inspect CONFROOM_PROTOCOLS
R3(config-pmap-c)# inspect

Step 3: Create the Zone Pairs
A zone pair allows you to specify a unidirectional firewall policy between two security zones. 
For example, a commonly used security policy dictates that the internal network can initiate any traffic towards the Internet but no traffic originating from the Internet should be allowed to reach the internal network.
This traffic policy requires only one zone pair, INTERNAL to INTERNET. Because zone-pairs define unidirectional traffic flow, another zone-pair must be created if Internet-initiated traffic must flow in the INTERNET to INTERNAL direction.
Notice that Cisco ZPF can be configured to inspect traffic that moves in the direction defined by the zone pair. In that situation, the firewall watches the traffic and dynamically creates rules allowing the return or related traffic to flow back through the router.

To define a zone pair, use the zone-pair security command. The direction of the traffic is specified by the source and destination zones.
For this workshop, you will create two zone-pairs:
INSIDE_TO_INTERNET: Allows traffic leaving the internal network towards the Internet.
CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET: Allows Internet access from the ConfRoom network.
a. Creating the zone-pairs:
R3(config)# zone-pair security INSIDE_TO_INTERNET source INSIDE destination INTERNET
R3(config)# zone-pair security CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET source CONFROOM destination INTERNET

b. Verify the zone-pairs were correctly created by issuing the show zone-pair security command. Notice that no policies are associated with the zone-pairs yet. The security policies will be applied to zone-pairs in the next step.
R3# show zone-pair security
Zone-pair name INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
    Source-Zone INSIDE  Destination-Zone INTERNET
    service-policy not configured
Zone-pair name CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET
    Source-Zone CONFROOM  Destination-Zone INTERNET
    service-policy not configured

Step 4: Applying Security Policies
a. As the last configuration step, apply the policy-maps to the zone-pairs:
R3(config)# zone-pair security INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
R3(config-sec-zone-pair)# service-policy type inspect INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
R3(config)# zone-pair security CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET
R3(config-sec-zone-pair)# service-policy type inspect CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET

b. Issue the show zone-pair security command once again to verify the zone-pair configuration. Notice that the service-polices are now displayed:
R3#show zone-pair security 
Zone-pair name INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
    Source-Zone INSIDE  Destination-Zone INTERNET 
    service-policy INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
Zone-pair name CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET
    Source-Zone CONFROOM  Destination-Zone INTERNET 
    service-policy CONFROOM_TO_INTERNET
To obtain more information about the zone-pairs, their policy-maps, the class-maps and match counters, use the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair command:
R3#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair 
policy exists on zp INSIDE_TO_INTERNET
  Zone-pair: INSIDE_TO_INTERNET 

  Service-policy inspect : INSIDE_TO_INTERNET

    Class-map: INSIDE_PROTOCOLS (match-any)  
      Match: protocol tcp
        0 packets, 0 bytes
        30 second rate 0 bps
      Match: protocol udp
        0 packets, 0 bytes
        30 second rate 0 bps
      Match: protocol icmp
        0 packets, 0 bytes
        30 second rate 0 bps

   Inspect
        Session creations since subsystem startup or last reset 0
        Current session counts (estab/half-open/terminating) [0:0:0]
        Maxever session counts (estab/half-open/terminating) [0:0:0]
        Last session created never
        Last statistic reset never
        Last session creation rate 0
        Maxever session creation rate 0
        Last half-open session total 0
        TCP reassembly statistics
        received 0 packets out-of-order; dropped 0
        peak memory usage 0 KB; current usage: 0 KB
        peak queue length 0


    Class-map: class-default (match-any)  
      Match: any 
      Drop
        0 packets, 0 bytes
[output omitted]

Step 5: Assign Interfaces to the Proper Security Zones
Interfaces (physical and logical) are assigned to security zones with the zone-member security interface command. 
a. Assign R3’s G0/0 to the CONFROOM security zone:
R3(config)# interface g0/0
R3(config-if)# zone-member security CONFROOM
b. Assign R3’s G0/1 to the INSIDE security zone:
R3(config)# interface g0/1
R3(config-if)# zone-member security INSIDE
c. Assign R3’s S0/0/1 to the INTERNET security zone:
R3(config)# interface s0/0/1
R3(config-if)# zone-member security INTERNET
Step 6: Verify Zone Assignment
a. Issue the show zone security command to ensure the zones were properly created, and the interfaces were correctly assigned:
R3# show zone security
zone self
  Description: System defined zone

zone CONFROOM
  Member Interfaces:
    GigEthernet0/0

zone INSIDE
  Member Interfaces:
    GigEthernet0/1

zone INTERNET
  Member Interfaces:
    Serial0/0/1

b. Even though no commands were issued to create a “self” zone, the output above still displays it. Why is R3 displaying a zone named “self”? What is the significance of this zone?
